ZOOKEEPER-4220: Potential redundant connection attempts during leader election  We have a logic in the server code  that would try to connect to an other quorum member  based on its server ID. We identify the address assigned to this ID first based on the last committed quorum configuration. If the connection attempt fails (or the server is not known in the committed configuration) then we try to find the address based on the last proposed quorum configuration. But we should do the second connection attempt  only if the address in the last proposed configuration differs from the address in the last committed configuration. Otherwise we would just retry to connect to the same address that failed just right before.  In the current code we have a bug  because we compare the address object references (use !=) instead of comparing the objects themselves (using not equals). In certain edge cases (e.g. when the last proposed and last committed addresses are the same  but the address is unreachable) this bug can lead to unnecessary retry of connection attempts. The normal behaviour would be to mark this connection attempt to be failed and wait for e.g. the next election round or wait for the other server to come online and initiate a connection to us.

ZOOKEEPER-3756: Members slow to rejoin quorum using Kubernetes  Whenever we close the current master ZooKeeper server  a new leader election is triggered. During the new election  a connection will be established between all the servers  by calling the synchronized 'connectOne' method in QuorumCnxManager. The method will open the socket and send a single small initial message to the other server  usually very quickly. If the destination host is unreachable  it should fail immediately.  However  when we use Kubernetes  then the destination host is always reachable as it points to Kubernetes services. If the actual container / pod is not available then the 'socket.connect' method will timeout (by default after 5 sec) instead of failing immediately with NoRouteToHostException. As the 'connectOne' method is synchronized  this timeout will block the creation of other connections  so a single unreachable host can cause timeout in the leader election protocol.  One workaround is to decrease the socket connection timeout with the '-Dzookeeper.cnxTimeout' stystem property  but the proper fix would be to make the connection initiation fully asynchronous  as using very low timeout can have its own side effect. Fortunately most of the initial message sending is already made async: the SASL authentication can take more time  so the second (authentication + initial message sending) part of the initiation protocol is already called in a separate thread  when Quorum SASL authentication is enabled.  In the following patch I made the whole connection initiation async  by always using the async executor (not only when Quorum SASL is enabled) and also moving the socket.connect call into the async thread.  I also created a unit test to verify my fix. I added a static socket factory that can be changed by the tests using a packet private setter method. My test failed (and produced the same error logs as we see in the original Jira ticket) before I applied my changes and a time-outed as no leader election succeeded after 15 seconds. After the changes the test runs very quickly  in 1-2 seconds.  Note: due to the multiAddress changes  we will need different PRs to the branch 3.5 and to the 3.6+ branches. I will submit the other PR once this got reviewed.

During the new election  a connection will be established between all the servers  by calling the synchronized 'connectOne' method in QuorumCnxManager. The method will open the socket and send a single small initial message to the other server  usually very quickly. If the destination host is unreachable  it should fail immediately.  However  when we use Kubernetes  then the destination host is always reachable as it points to Kubernetes services. If the actual container / pod is not available then the 'socket.connect' method will timeout (by default after 5 sec) instead of failing immediately with NoRouteToHostException. As the 'connectOne' method is synchronized  this timeout will block the creation of other connections  so a single unreachable host can cause timeout in the leader election protocol.  One workaround is to decrease the socket connection timeout with the '-Dzookeeper.cnxTimeout' stystem property  but the proper fix would be to make the connection initiation fully asynchronous  as using very low timeout can have its own side effect. Fortunately most of the initial message sending is already made async: the SASL authentication can take more time  so the second (authentication + initial message sending) part of the initiation protocol is already called in a separate thread  when Quorum SASL authentication is enabled.  In the following patch I made the whole connection initiation async  by always using the async executor (not only when Quorum SASL is enabled) and also moving the socket.connect call into the async thread.  I also created a unit test to verify my fix. I added a static socket factory that can be changed by the tests using a packet private setter method. My test failed (and produced the same error logs as we see in the original Jira ticket) before I applied my changes and a time-outed as no leader election succeeded after 15 seconds. After the changes the test runs very quickly  in 1-2 seconds.  Note: due to the multiAddress changes  we will need different PRs to the branch 3.5 and to the 3.6+ branches. I will submit the other PR once this got reviewed.

ZOOKEEPER-4200: Widen latency window in WatcherCleanerTest  `WatcherCleanerTest` performs latency checks which fail when outside of a 20+Xms window.  Before this patch  X was 5ms—whereas 30+ms is frequently seen on an i5 Mac Mini running macOS Catalina.  This dumb patch just widens the window to 20ms  which makes it work on my machine  but could obviously still fail in a loaded environment or VM.

ZOOKEEPER-3769: handling malformed Leader Election notification messages  Using ZooKeeper with JDK 12.0.2 on CentOS 7 when the current leader is killed  we saw a few times that some partial Leader Election notification (vote) messages were delivered to the other ZooKeeper servers. The malformed / partial messages are causing different exceptions in the WorkerReceiver thread of FastLeaderElection which were not handled before. This was leading to the death of the WorkerReceiver thread  which caused that the given ZooKeeper Server was unable to receive leader election messages anymore and was not able to re-join to any quorum until it got restarted.  In the proposed fix I created unit tests to simulate certain error cases with regards to partial leader election messages  and fixed the error handling in FastLeaderElection.

In the proposed fix I created unit tests to simulate certain error cases with regards to partial leader election messages  and fixed the error handling in FastLeaderElection.

ZOOKEEPER-3113: EphemeralType.get() fails to verify ephemeralOwner when currentElapsedTime() is small enough  I refactored the unit test `testServerIds` to verify server id verification code explicitly instead of through `EphemeralType.get()` method.  Reasons: - The original test doesn't work on machines which booted recently  because the generated `Time.currentElapsedTime()` value is not high enough and it's possible to generate a valid ephemeralOwner even with high 0xff byte. Server ID cannot be verified reliably this way. - EphemeralType.get() is already covered in other unit tests  - Unit tests should test the smallest piece of logic and call the method under testing directly.

ZOOKEEPER-3781: Create snapshots on followers when snapshot.trust.empty is true  snapshot.trust.empty is an escape hatch for users upgrading from 3.4.x to later Zookeeper versions  allowing nodes to start with a non-empty transaction log but no snapshot.  The intent is for this setting to be enabled for a short while during the upgrade  and then disabled again  as the check it disables is a safety feature.  Prior to this PR  a node would only write a snapshot locally if it became leader  or if it had fallen so far behind the leader that the leader sent a SNAP message instead of a DIFF. This made the upgrade process inconvenient  as not all nodes would create a snapshot when snapshot.trust.empty was true  meaning that the safety check could not be flipped back on.  This PR makes follower nodes write a local snapshot when they receive NEWLEADER  if they have no local snapshot and snapshot.trust.empty is true.

Prior to this PR  a node would only write a snapshot locally if it became leader  or if it had fallen so far behind the leader that the leader sent a SNAP message instead of a DIFF. This made the upgrade process inconvenient  as not all nodes would create a snapshot when snapshot.trust.empty was true  meaning that the safety check could not be flipped back on.  This PR makes follower nodes write a local snapshot when they receive NEWLEADER  if they have no local snapshot and snapshot.trust.empty is true.

ZOOKEEPER-3911: Data inconsistency caused by DIFF sync uncommitted log  Problem:  During DIFF sync  followers will persist the proposals from leader only after receiving the UPTODATE message.

So it's possible that when leader starting serving  followers might not persistent all of the DIFF sync proposals from leader.

ZOOKEEPER-2901: TTL Nodes don't work with Server IDs > 127  There was a major oversight when TTL nodes were implemented. The session ID generator for each server is seeded with the configured Server ID in the high byte. TTL Nodes were using the highest bit to denote a TTL node when used in the ephemeral owner. This meant that Server IDs > 127 that created ephemeral nodes would have those nodes always considered TTL nodes (with the TTL being essentially a random number).  This PR fixes the issue by disabling TTL Nodes by default. They must now be enabled in zoo.cfg. When TTL Nodes are enabled  the max Server ID changes from 255 to 254. This allows the high byte of a session ID stored in the ephemeral owner to use 0xFF to denote a TTL node.  About this change:  - The doc has been updated to note that TTL nodes are disabled by default and must be enabled via config. Also  the docs explains that when TTL nodes are enabled the max Server ID becomes 254 - The TTL implementation has been updated to use 0xFF in the high byte of the ephemeralOwner to denote a TTL node. This decreases the max TTL by an insignificant amount - PrepRequestProcessor now throws `KeeperException.UnimplementedException` when an attempt to create a TTL node is made but the server has not been configured to enable TTL Nodes. - QuorumPeer throws a `RuntimeException` if TTL Nodes are enabled but the Server ID > 254 - Tests have been added to validate all of this  IMPORTANT NOTE: TTL Nodes created in 3.5.3 will revert to EPHEMERAL with this change.

The session ID generator for each server is seeded with the configured Server ID in the high byte. TTL Nodes were using the highest bit to denote a TTL node when used in the ephemeral owner. This meant that Server IDs > 127 that created ephemeral nodes would have those nodes always considered TTL nodes (with the TTL being essentially a random number).  This PR fixes the issue by disabling TTL Nodes by default. They must now be enabled in zoo.cfg. When TTL Nodes are enabled  the max Server ID changes from 255 to 254. This allows the high byte of a session ID stored in the ephemeral owner to use 0xFF to denote a TTL node.  About this change:  - The doc has been updated to note that TTL nodes are disabled by default and must be enabled via config. Also  the docs explains that when TTL nodes are enabled the max Server ID becomes 254 - The TTL implementation has been updated to use 0xFF in the high byte of the ephemeralOwner to denote a TTL node. This decreases the max TTL by an insignificant amount - PrepRequestProcessor now throws `KeeperException.UnimplementedException` when an attempt to create a TTL node is made but the server has not been configured to enable TTL Nodes. - QuorumPeer throws a `RuntimeException` if TTL Nodes are enabled but the Server ID > 254 - Tests have been added to validate all of this  IMPORTANT NOTE: TTL Nodes created in 3.5.3 will revert to EPHEMERAL with this change.

This decreases the max TTL by an insignificant amount - PrepRequestProcessor now throws `KeeperException.UnimplementedException` when an attempt to create a TTL node is made but the server has not been configured to enable TTL Nodes. - QuorumPeer throws a `RuntimeException` if TTL Nodes are enabled but the Server ID > 254 - Tests have been added to validate all of this  IMPORTANT NOTE: TTL Nodes created in 3.5.3 will revert to EPHEMERAL with this change.

This meant that Server IDs > 127 that created ephemeral nodes would have those nodes always considered TTL nodes (with the TTL being essentially a random number).  This PR fixes the issue by disabling TTL Nodes by default. They must now be enabled in zoo.cfg. When TTL Nodes are enabled  the max Server ID changes from 255 to 254. This allows the high byte of a session ID stored in the ephemeral owner to use 0xFF to denote a TTL node.  About this change:  - The doc has been updated to note that TTL nodes are disabled by default and must be enabled via config. Also  the docs explains that when TTL nodes are enabled the max Server ID becomes 254 - The TTL implementation has been updated to use 0xFF in the high byte of the ephemeralOwner to denote a TTL node. This decreases the max TTL by an insignificant amount - PrepRequestProcessor now throws `KeeperException.UnimplementedException` when an attempt to create a TTL node is made but the server has not been configured to enable TTL Nodes. - QuorumPeer throws a `RuntimeException` if TTL Nodes are enabled but the Server ID > 254 - Tests have been added to validate all of this  IMPORTANT NOTE: TTL Nodes created in 3.5.3 will revert to EPHEMERAL with this change.

ZOOKEEPER-2757: Incorrect path crashes zkCli  This issue is caused by ZooKeeper relying on `IllegalArgumentException` in `PathUtils#validatePath`. `IllegalArgumentException` is an unchecked exception and we never catch it within each individual *Command.java  so it bubbles up and kills the CLI.  Given that throwing `IllegalArgumentException` is part of ZooKeeper's API  I believe that unfortunately we can not change this behavior at this time. This patch catches `IllegalArgumentException` and wraps it  so the CLI prints an error but does not quit. I believe I handled all of the relevant commands  please check to make sure I am not missing any.

ZOOKEEPER-3056: Fails to load database with missing snapshot file but with valid transaction log file.  ZOOKEEPER-2325 introduced a check on snapshot and transaction log files during recovery  which will treat empty or missing snapshot files with the presence of transaction log files illegal state  and abort start up process.  For old versions of ZooKeeper  it's possible to have valid transaction log files but no snapshot. For example  if snap count set too low  or server crashes before the first snapshot was taken. For new versions of ZooKeeper with ZOOKEEPER-2325  this is not a problem as ZooKeeper will make sure the presence of at least one snapshot file (e.g. on a fresh start with empty local data  ZooKeeper will create one snapshot file as part of the start up.).  So we need provide a smooth upgrade path for users with old version of ZooKeeper. This patch introduces a system property flag  once set  will skip the empty snapshot validation during start up. The default value of this flag is false  as we don't want to disable the features introduced in ZOOKEEPER-2325. We also want the flag to be explicitly set by admin  as ZooKeeper itself is not able to tell when to trust missing snapshot or not.

ZOOKEEPER-2325 introduced a check on snapshot and transaction log files during recovery  which will treat empty or missing snapshot files with the presence of transaction log files illegal state  and abort start up process.  For old versions of ZooKeeper  it's possible to have valid transaction log files but no snapshot. For example  if snap count set too low  or server crashes before the first snapshot was taken. For new versions of ZooKeeper with ZOOKEEPER-2325  this is not a problem as ZooKeeper will make sure the presence of at least one snapshot file (e.g. on a fresh start with empty local data  ZooKeeper will create one snapshot file as part of the start up.).  So we need provide a smooth upgrade path for users with old version of ZooKeeper. This patch introduces a system property flag  once set  will skip the empty snapshot validation during start up. The default value of this flag is false  as we don't want to disable the features introduced in ZOOKEEPER-2325. We also want the flag to be explicitly set by admin  as ZooKeeper itself is not able to tell when to trust missing snapshot or not.

ZOOKEEPER-2786: Flaky test: org.apache.zookeeper.test.ClientTest.testNonExistingOpCode  This is the third time this failure has popped up. This time it seemed to only impact tests run using NettyServerCnxnFactory (so it only impacts 3.5 and master) and I was able to get it to pop up with sufficient frequency when running the tests locally.  The issue is caused by improper handling of netty's futures. When we call `channel.write(wrappedBuffer(sendBuffer));` the write is completed asynchronously. The close call `channel.close();` is also asynchronous. So we can run into the case where the close occurs before a write.  This patch changes our close call to be a callback for the completion of an empty write. This way we are guaranteed that the channel has drained before a close.  My primary concern with this patch is the channel being used while it is closing (between the write of an empty buffer and the execution of the close callback). I have added a `closingChannel` boolean to track that  which I believe is sufficient. Let me know if anyone finds a situation where that is not the case.

ZOOKEEPER-2164: Quorum members can not rejoin after restart  Ever since ZOOKEEPER-107 (released in 3.5.0) the servers are sending their addresses during initial connection requests. The receiving server can potentially use these addresses to send back a new connection request if the challenge is won by the receiver.  If the server config contains wildcard address (e.g. 0.0.0.0 in case of IPv4) then the first connection request sent by A to B will contain this address. If the ID of A is smaller than the ID of B  then A will lose the challenge and the second connection request sent back by B will never reach A  as B will send the initial message to 0.0.0.0.  So in any 3.5+ ZooKeeper  if wildcard addresses are used in the configs  then there might be some servers never able to rejoin to the quorum after they got restarted.  In 3.5+ for backward compatibility reasons (needed during rolling upgrade) there is a version of the QuorumCnxManager.connectOne() method that needs no election address but use the last known address to initiate the connection. In this commit  we simply call this method if the address is a wildcard address.  I also added a few restart realted tests  to make sure that restart still works when we don't use wildcard addresses. We can not test the original error with unit tests  as it would require to start the quorum on multiple hosts.  I also tested the patch for rolling restart manually both with and without wildcard addresses in the config.

ZOOKEEPER-3079: avoid unsafe use of sprintf(3)  The function format_endpoint_info declares both addrstr and buf as 128 element char arrays  however on non-Windows platforms it calls sprintf(3) to write into buf the value of addrstr followed by ':' followed by the the port number.  This causes a compiler error when building with GCC 8 because this could potentially overflow buf if the value of addrstr was ever 127 characters long (or a little less depending on how many digits are in port).  Of course  this couldn't actually happen because addrstr is initialized by inet_ntop(3) which won't write more than INET6_ADDRSTRLEN bytes (defined in <netinet/in.h> on POSIX-compliant systems).

ZOOKEEPER-1990: fix Random instances  See the jira for more info.  Basically we have multiple ways of creating Random instances in ZooKeeper. Since java 1.7  the default constructor is good enough even in multi-threaded environment  we get a good seed. But in some places  we just create a random instance  where System.nanotime is the seed  which is not a good practice in multi-threaded environments.  I only replaced those  and I also left the tests as is  because in some cases it is intentional in them.

ZOOKEEPER-3793: Request throttling is broken when RequestThrottler is disabled or configured incorrectly..  When RequestThrottler is not enabled or is enabled but configured incorrectly  ZooKeeper server will stop throttling. This is a serious bug as without request throttling  it's fairly easy to overwhelm ZooKeeper which leads to all sorts of issues.  This is a regression introduced in ZOOKEEPER-3243  where the total number of queued requests in request processing pipeline is not taking into consideration when deciding whether to throttle or not  or only taken into consideration conditionally based on RequestThrottler's configurations. We should make sure always taking into account the number of queued requests in request processing pipeline before making throttling decisions.

THRIFT-(1418|1507|3983|4120|4178|4259|4294): Multiple issues Client: java  THRIFT-4294: Java Configure Fails for Ant >= 1.10 THRIFT-4259: Thrift does not compile due to Ant Maven task errors THRIFT-4178: Java libraries missing from package when using cmake THRIFT-3983: libthrift is deployed on central with pom packaging              instead of jar THRIFT-1507: Maven can't download resource from central when behind              a proxy and won't use local repository THRIFT-1418: Compiling Thrift from source: Class              org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.ConditionTask doesn't              support the nested typefound element  Refactor CMake install hook to allow using sudo make install/fast which avoids the THRIFT-1507 and THRIFT-1418 issues.  New Gradle based build system for Thrift Java Library  * Add Gradle 4.4.1 Wrapper artifacts to enable builds Using the Gradle Wrapper helps normalize the builds on all platforms so we use a consistent build tool independent of package managers.  The Gradle build logic was partitioned into multiple specific scripts to simplify understanding and maintenance of the build.  This is now hooked into CMake and Autoconf processing steps and can build/test/publish to Maven. The README.md was updated to illustrate the new build options and add some documentation on the requirements for Maven publication.  Cleaned up the CMake files to reduce reliance on file globbing which is known to cause confusion when multiple users contribute.  * Fix two minor issues in Javadoc and unit test  Return values were undeclared in Javadoc Test was asserting on the wrong test object instance  * Create simple runner scripts for cross-check  Using Gradle as a java execution wrapper is too heavy. I simplified the test client/server execution by using a three generated scripts in the build directory direcly callable by the cross-check test harness.  * Cleanup the remaining Ant build scripts  Pulled the Maven Ant task properties out of the Java build since they are no longer used there. Deleted the no longer used build.xml and build.properties files from the Java build. Made each Ant build own the Maven Ant task details in their build.properties file.  * Fix the build issue with Java SSL in the ubuntu-trusty container  The latest Trusty JDK7 builds seem to have encountered this issue because the OpenJDK removed the SunEC algorithms.  * Update the developer info as requested in review  Use the generic Apache Thrift developer list for contact information  * Add Clover Code coverage for easy access by developers  Clover plugin for Gradle was applied and configured which enables code coverage reports to be available on demand via a command line option. The documentation in the README.md was enhanced to give the details of this change and how to take advantage of it.THRIFT-4546: replace all git-wip-us.apache.org to github.com.

THRIFT-5432 TSaslTransport throw TTransportException of MaxMessageSize reached Client: java Patch: GuangMing Lu. THRIFT-4805: Suppress excessive logging of SASL TTransportExceptions in case of END_OF_FILE  Two fixes here:  1. Additional logic to properly catch and handle TTransportException.    Currently  T(SASL)TransportException gets caught and handled in    the wrong catch-block. 2. The fix for THRIFT-3769 mutes _all_ TTransportExceptions in TThreadPoolServer.    This might mute legitimate failures. The intent of THRIFT-3769 (and    THRIFT-2268) was to mute the noise caused by TTransportException.END_OF_FILE.    This commit lets legitimate failures to be bubbled upwards.THRIFT-4506: fix use of assert for correctness in Java SASL negotiation Client: java.
